# K-means Clustering

In this project, I implemented **K-means Clustering** using **Scikit-Learn** to perform **unsupervised machine learning**.  
The project focuses on **customer segmentation**, where data points are grouped into different clusters based on similarities.

## **Objectives**

After completing this project, I was able to:

- Understand the concept of **K-means clustering** and how it works.
- Use **Scikit-Learn's KMeans** algorithm to cluster data.
- Apply K-means clustering on a **real-world dataset** for **customer segmentation**.
- Visualize clusters to understand customer group behaviors.

## **Project Overview**

**K-means** is one of the most widely used **unsupervised learning algorithms** for clustering data into **k groups** based on feature similarity.  
In this project, I explored its real-world application in **customer segmentation**.

### **Key Steps**
- **Loading the Dataset**: Customer data for segmentation.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Scaling and cleaning the data.
- **Applying K-means**: Using `KMeans` from **Scikit-Learn** to group similar customers.
- **Choosing Optimal Clusters**: Using the **Elbow Method** to find the best number of clusters.
- **Visualization**: Creating scatter plots to display different clusters.

## **Real-World Applications**
- Customer segmentation for marketing strategies.
- Understanding website visitor patterns.
- Pattern recognition in datasets.
- Feature engineering for ML models.
- Data compression and dimensionality reduction.

## **Technologies Used**
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
